* Mutter - A secure, extensible, lightweight, multi-protocol VOIP/chat server.

Mutter is designed to be 100% compatible with a subset of the Mumble protocol 
(enough so that you can use any Mumble client to interoperate with it). It will
also support additional factor authentication, voicemail, and bridging to other
chat servers such as Jabber (XMPP).

Mutter is targeted to run anywhere LuaJIT and OpenSSL (or equivalent) is supported.
